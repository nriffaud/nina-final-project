# nina-final-project


Need a vibe change? Pick the vibe you want to feel, and Vibe With Us will tell you what music you should put on, and what drink you should pour yourself. It'll offer the ultimate vibe change. 

GOAL
To help people get a vibe change when they need one. Whether it's to pick them up, knock them down, take them away, put them to sleep, or anything else, we've got the vibe for you. 


Deliverables
Wireframe image connected. But thinking a retro color scheme. There will be a header with `Vibe With Us` and a little blurb about needing a vibe change. Then below it will be the content where you can pick the vibe you want, and javascript will make that clickable and interactive. Then at the bottom, I will have a subscribe to the vibe thing, because in the long term, I am hoping to start a podcast that will incorporate certain drinks (anything from merlot to chocolate milk to sunny d to moscow mules). So there will eventually be a button linking to that, and also a contact us and other stuff you'd see on a nav bar.
